# /lib/assets

This directory holds static asset files that are imported and used directly within your application's code, typically by the build system.

**Examples:**

- Custom font files (`.ttf`, `.woff`, `.otf`) that you import and use with `@font-face` in your CSS or with a library like `@next/font`.
- Small, static JSON files that you want to bundle with your application's JavaScript.
