# /components/misc

This directory serves as a catch-all for miscellaneous, general-purpose, and utility-focused components that do not fit neatly into any of the other more specific categories.

These are often helper components that encapsulate a specific piece of logic or a common UI pattern that isn't a standard design system primitive (like a Button or Card).

**Examples:**

- `ClickAwayListener`: A component that triggers a function when a user clicks outside of it.
- `SectionBreak`: A decorative separator used between content sections.
- `ErrorBoundary`: A component to catch and handle rendering errors in its children.
