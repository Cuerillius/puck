# /components/puck-fields

This directory is used for extending Puck with custom input fields for the editor's sidebar.

When the default fields (like `text`, `number`, `select`) are not sufficient, you can create your own custom React components to provide a more tailored editing experience for your components' props.

**Examples:**

- `upload-file`: A custom field that provides a UI for uploading an image or file and returns its URL.
- `IconPicker`: A field that shows a grid of available icons for the user to choose from.
- `ColorPicker`: A field that presents a visual color palette.
