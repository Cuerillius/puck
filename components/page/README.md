# /components/page

This directory contains "macro" components that are used to construct the primary structure and layout of specific pages or large, complex sections within a page.

Unlike the atomic components in `/ui`, these are larger compositions that often combine multiple smaller components. They define significant parts of the user experience.

**Examples:**

- `PageRender`: A component that takes page data and renders the entire content area.
- `Parallax`: A complex hero section with parallax scrolling effects.
- `PostLayout`: A layout component that structures a blog post with a header, content area, and sidebar.
