# /components/puck-overrides

This directory is for advanced Puck customization. It contains React components that **replace or override** the default UI of the Puck editor itself.

This allows you to change the look and feel of the editor, add custom buttons to the header, or completely redesign parts of the editing interface. Use this when you need to fundamentally alter the editor experience, not for creating content.

**Examples:**

- `PuckHeader`: A custom component to replace the entire top header of the Puck editor.
- `PageHeaderActions`: A component that adds new buttons (like "View Live") next to the "Publish" button.
- `CustomDrawer`: A replacement for the default component drawer.
