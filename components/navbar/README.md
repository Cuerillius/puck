# /components/navbar

This directory contains all the React components that are made available to a seperate content editor inside the Puck visual editor that is only used to create the navbar.

These are the fundamental building blocks that users can drag, drop, and configure to create the navbar. Each component here must be registered in the navbar Puck configuration file (`lib/config/navbar.config.ts`) to appear in the editor.
